# OpenRAM-Array-Generation
Generating arrays of different sizes using OpenRAM, with the FreePDK45 Technology node. The intent is to compare and contrast the layouts of the generated arrays.

_Note_ - The multi-banking layouts are not yet generated, as openRAM has temporarily redacted the support for multi-banking.
